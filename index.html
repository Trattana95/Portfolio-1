                Hello my name is Thom Rattana. I live in High Point, NC and prior to starting this bootcamp i was
                working as a forklift
                operator at a trucking industy. I worked there for 3yrs, such a simple and easy job but the job
                enviroment was horrible.
                The air was alway dirty which is very bad for your lungs, not to mention the stress to your body from
                driving a
                forklift all day. I decided, i had enought of this dirty enviroment and it was time was a change of pace
                and finally go into
                a field i could see myself doing for many years. I've always wanted dive into the field of coding but i
                didn't know where i could
                go to start my journey. I saw an ad for the UNCC bootcamp for coding and that's when i took the chance
                to go for coding.

              </p>

              <p>
                I plan to do this UNCC bootcamp full timer and invest all my time into the program. I don't have really
                have any hobbies, But i
                do enjoy cars very much and recently tennis. I don't have many friends the enjoy tennis so its hard to
                find someone to play
                with. I grew up loving cars since i was in high school. I used to dream of building a car to stand out
                and be proud. I've achieved
                that recently with my car and i'm very happy with the results. There were many trial and errors just
                getting the car to be how i
                wanted it and money, but im content with how the outcome is now.
