          <p>
            Hello my name is Thom Rattana. I live in High Point, NC and prior to starting this bootcamp i was
            working as a forklift
            operator at a trucking industy. I worked there for 3yrs, such a simple and easy job but the job
            enviroment was horrible.
            The air was alway dirty which is very bad for your lungs, not to mention the stress to your body from
            driving a
            forklift all day. I decided, i had enought of this dirty enviroment and it was time was a change of pace
            and finally go into
            a field i could see myself doing for many years. I've always wanted dive into the field of coding but i
            didn't know where i could
            go to start my journey. I saw an ad for the UNCC bootcamp for coding and that's when i took the chance
            to go for coding.

          </p>

          <p>
            I plan to do this UNCC bootcamp full timer and invest all my time into the program. I don't have really
            have any hobbies, But i
            do enjoy cars very much and recently tennis. I don't have many friends the enjoy tennis so its hard to
            find someone to play
            with. I grew up loving cars since i was in high school. I used to dream of building a car to stand out
            and be proud. I've achieved
            that recently with my car and i'm very happy with the results. There were many trial and errors just
            getting the car to be how i
            wanted it and money, but im content with how the outcome is now.
